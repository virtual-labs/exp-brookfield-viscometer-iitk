The semisolid pharmaceuitical preparations such as creams, gels and suspensions comprises of the largest part in the pharmaceutical industry. Hence, Viscosity and rheology are monitored for quality control, consistency and pharmacopoeial regulations during formulation of ointments and gels. Rheological properties such as viscosity and thixotropy of semi-solid dosage forms can influence their drug delivery by directly influencing the diffusion rate of the drug.
