<b>Apparatus and Materials:</b><br>
● Brookfield viscometer (e.g., Model DV-E or DV2T)<br>
● Semi-solid sample (e.g., ointment, gel, or cream)<br>
● Sample container (preferably a 250 mL beaker)<br>
●Appropriate spindle (as per sample type, e.g., spindle no. 4)<br>
● Thermometer<br>
● Stopwatch (if needed)<br>
● Water bath (optional, to maintain temperature)<br>

<b>Procedure:</b><br>
● Ensure the viscometer is calibrated and leveled properly.<br>
● Select the appropriate spindle according to the sample's consistency.<br>
● Transfer the semi-solid sample into the container without entrapping air bubbles.<br>
● Insert the spindle into the sample, ensuring it is properly immersed without touching the container walls.<br>
● Set the spindle rotation speed as recommended (typically 10, 20, or 50 RPM).<br>
● Start the viscometer and allow the spindle to rotate until the reading stabilizes.<br>
● Record the viscosity value displayed on the screen.<br>
● Repeat the reading at different spindle speeds if required.<br>
● Record the temperature of the sample during measurement.<br>

<b>Calculations:</b><br>
No manual calculation is required as the Brookfield viscometer provides direct readings of viscosity. However, corrections may be applied if temperature deviates significantly from standard conditions.<br>

<b>Results:</b><br>
The viscosity of the given semi-solid sample at ___ °C is found to be _____ cP using spindle no. ___ at ___ RPM.<br>

<b>Conclusion:</b><br>
The Brookfield viscometer is a reliable instrument for determining the viscosity of semi-solid samples. The viscosity of the tested sample was within acceptable limits for its intended use, confirming its consistency and quality.

<b>Precautions:</b><br>
● Ensure the spindle is clean and dry before use.<br>
● Avoid air bubbles during sample transfer.<br>
● Maintain a constant temperature throughout the test.<br>
● Do not allow the spindle to touch the bottom or sides of the container.
